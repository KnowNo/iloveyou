You can get a quick views of the website by downloading the war package-iloveyou.war, And then copy it to the param baseDir of the http server 
of tomcat. Lanuching tomcat server.Inputing the web address of "http://localhost:8080/iloveyou" on the browser.All of the username and password are "iloveyou".Good luck~~~

##Usage##
I believe that It's not necessary to repeat what someone else have did. So I 
have used many web pages which gether from the internet. They are very pretty and all have a cool design. Many thanks for their authors.

This is a common Java Web project.You might have some revamps before you use it.
eg: the name,picture and word and at all.
	罗密欧->your name
	朱丽叶->her name

You just need use the WebRoot and src to replace you project. All of the static pages are in the /WebRoot/home, different model have different Working directory.Fellowing is the map of the model and the directory:
	爱你<-->/WebRoot/home/iloveyou
	
	
	

##Acknowledgements##
But what I want to empharize is that I'm not good at Web development and especially in Front End. Factly, most of my time are concentrated on background development. Most web pages of this project are get from internet, and I just put them together.If you have any questions or proposals you can contact me by the email:cfreestar@163.com. Thank you for your interesting.
